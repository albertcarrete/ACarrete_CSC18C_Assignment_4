 * ================================================
 * Eratosthenes With Queues
 * 
 * 1. 	Create a queue named queueOfIntegers, enqueue 
 * 		it with consecutive integers 2 through n.
 * 2. 	Create an empty queue to store primes, perhaps 
 * 		named queueOfPrimes.
 * 3. 	Do
 * 4. 	Get the next prime number, p, by removing the 
 * 		first value in queueOfNumbers.
 * 5. 	Enqueue the value of p into queue of primes. 
 * 6. 	Create a new queue and fill this queue by doing 
 * 		the following:
 * 			- While queueOfNumbers is not empty, dequeue
 * 			the front number, if it is not divisible by
 * 			p then enequeue this number to newQueue 
 * 			(queueOfPrimes.back() is our current prime
 * 			number)
 * 8.	Assign the queueOfNumbers object with the newly created queue object
 * 9. 	While (queueOfPrimes.back() < sqrt(n))
 * 10.	Display the primes, which are all the values in the queueOfPrimes object.
